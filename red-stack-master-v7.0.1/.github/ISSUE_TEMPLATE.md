## Before you hit that Submit button....

This issue tracker is for problems with the RED-Stack runtime, the editor or the core nodes.

If your issue is:
  - a general 'how-to' type question,
  - a feature request or suggestion for a change,
  - or problems with 3rd party (`red-stack-contrib-`) nodes

please use the [RED-Stack Forum](##).

You could also consider asking a question on [Stack Overflow](###) and tag it `red-stack`.

That way the whole RED-Stack user community can help, rather than rely on the core development team.
