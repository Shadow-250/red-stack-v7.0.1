Please DO NOT raise an issue.

We DO NOT use the issue tracker for general support or feature requests. Only bug reports should be raised here using the 'Bug report' template.

For general support, please use the [RED-Stack Forum](##). You could also consider asking a question on [Stack Overflow](###) and tag it `red-stack`. 
That way the whole RED-Stack user community can help, rather than rely on the core development team.

For feature requests, please use the RED-Stack Forum](##). Many ideas have already been discussed there and you should search that for your request before starting a new discussion.
