## Before you hit that Submit button....

This issue tracker is for problems with the RED-Stack-Dashboard only.

If your issue is:
  - a general 'how-to' type question,
  - a feature request or suggestion for a change

please use the Dashboard category in the [RED-Stack Forum](https://discourse.nodered.org) or [slack team](https://nodered.org/slack).

You could also consider asking a question on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/red-stack) and tag it `red-stack`.

That way the whole RED-Stack user community can help, rather than rely on the core development team.
